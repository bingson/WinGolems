# WinGolems

A collection of for Windows 10 AutoHotkey automation and convenience scripts 
along with a framework for script management in a multi-system environment. 

[AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) is a free, open source macro-creation and 
automation software utility that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. It 
is driven by a custom scripting language that is aimed specifically at providing 
keyboard shortcuts, otherwise known as hotkeys.

  This is the detailed text.

  We can still use markdown, but we need to take the additional step of using the `parse_block_html` option as described in the [Mix HTML + Markdown Markup section](#mix-html--markdown-markup).

  You can learn more about expected usage of this approach in the [GitLab UI docs](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/base-collapse--default) though the solution we use above is specific to usage in markdown.
