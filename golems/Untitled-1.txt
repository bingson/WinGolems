This is a Command Box (CB), an always-on-top keyboard-driven 
graphical user interface. 

Features: 

 + Designed with WinGolem's memory functions in mind, the CB can
   be used to display and modify contents of any .txt or .ini file. 

 + Can be used to call and parametize functions on the fly
   to modify selected text or manipulate application windows.

 + Can also be used to create a new layer of context specific 
   keyboard shortcuts that are active only when a particular 
   command box is open

 + Has a minimalist docked command line mode (no display pane) 
   accessible by pressing alt + x
